This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error when using the `calc()` function in CSS, particularly within flexbox layouts. The bug arises from misunderstandings about how `calc()` interacts with percentages and fixed values in contexts where the parent container's size isn't explicitly set.  The solution provides a corrected approach, ensuring the intended layout behavior is achieved.
